# TheTechLearner

This is the official forum of TheTechLearner on GitHub. We have opened our public organization-profile on GitHub for the first time to start an amazing open source journey from scratch. 

## About
TheTechLearner is an educational blog on technical facts/updates, case studies on latest tech stacks & a ground level door to digital marketing tips and cracks based on blogging, especially it has earned a remarkable idenitity after publishing its series of 'How to Start your blog', made for newbie bloggers.

TheTechLearner was initially hosted on 16th January 2018 on 'WordPress.com' platform with its free blogging services which was founded & started as a new journey by [Rajdeep Das](https://github.com/Rajspeaks) and after a month of recreating the whole website, it was officially published on 2nd February, 2018.

P.S.- It's still not a money-earning professional blog i.e. a  non-profitable free learning blog with limited services but reached a huge reader base by 2019. From 2020 to till now it's not a regular publishing blog but frequently promoting latest tech news & most trending discussed topics on its social media handles.
