# TheTechLearner

This is the official forum of TheTechLearner on GitHub. We have opened our public on GitHub first time to start an amazing open source journey from scratch. 

## About
TheTechLearner is an educational blog on technical facts/updates, case studies on tech stacks & digital marketing, especially earned a remarkable idenitity after publishing its series of 'How to Start your blog', made for newbie bloggers.

TheTechLearner was initially hosted on 16th January 2018 on 'WordPress.com' platform with its free blogging services, founded & started a new journey by Rajdeep Das and after a month of recreating the whole site, it was officially published on 2nd February, 2018.

It's still not a money-earning professional blog i.e. a  non-profitable free learning blog with limited services but reached a huge reader base by 2019. From 2020 to till now it's not a regular publishing blog but frequently promoting latest tech news & most trending discussed topics on its social media handles.
